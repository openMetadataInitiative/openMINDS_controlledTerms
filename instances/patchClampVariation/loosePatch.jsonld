  "definition": "A variation of the patch-clamp technique involving a seal with low electrical resistance.",
  "description": "This technique employs a loose seal (low electrical resistance) rather than the tight gigaseal used in the conventional technique. A significant advantage of the loose seal is that the pipette can be repeatedly removed from the membrane after recording, and the membrane will remain intact. This allows repeated measurements in a variety of locations on the same cell without destroying the integrity of the membrane. [Wikipedia]",
