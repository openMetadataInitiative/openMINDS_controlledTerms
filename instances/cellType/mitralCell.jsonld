    "definition": "Mitral cells are a neuronal cell type in the mammalian olfactory bulb, distinguished by the position of their somata located in an orderly row in the mitral cell layer of the bulb.",
    "description": "Principal neuron located in the olfactory bulb in the mammalian central nervous system. The cell bodies are arranged in a thin layer between the granule cell layer and the external plexiform layer. Each mitral cell is usually characterized in the mammal by a single primary dendrite that traverses the external plexiform layer and terminates within an olfactory glomerulus in a tuft of branches which receives input from the axons of olfactory receptor neurons. Axons of the mitral cells project to a number of areas in the brain, including the piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex, olfactory tubercle, and amygdala.",
