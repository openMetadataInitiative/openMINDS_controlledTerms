    "definition": "Small intrinsic neuron in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, with cell bodies surrounding the olfactory glomerulus.",
    "description": " The cell body is 6-8 um in diameter, from which arises a short bushy dendrite that arborizes within a glomerulus, where it receives synaptic input from olfactory receptor cell axon terminals, and engages in dendrodendritic interactions with mitral/tufted cell dendrites. Occasionally, bitufted PG cells connected to two glomeruli are seen. The axon distributes laterally within the extraglomerular region, extending as far as 5-10 glomeruli away. Some PG cells appear to lack axons. Subtypes may be identified based on their biochemical constituents.",
