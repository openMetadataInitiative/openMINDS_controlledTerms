    "definition": "Principal neuron located in the outer third of the external plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb in the mammalian central nervous system.",
    "description": "Each tufted cell is characterized by usually a single short primary dendrite that traverses the outer external plexiform layer and terminates within an olfactory glomerulus in a tuft of branches, where it receives the input from olfactory receptor neuron axon terminals. Differentiated from external tufted cells. Axons of the tufted cells transfer information to a number of areas in the brain, including the piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex, olfactory tubercle, and amygdala.",
