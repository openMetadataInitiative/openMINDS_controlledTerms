  "definition": "In magnetic resonance imaging, a 'spin echo pulse sequence' is a contrast generation technique that induces bulk changes in the spin magnetization of a sample by applying sequential pulses of resonant electromagnetic waves at different angles (cf. [Fonseca (2013)](https://doi.org/10.5772/53693)).",
