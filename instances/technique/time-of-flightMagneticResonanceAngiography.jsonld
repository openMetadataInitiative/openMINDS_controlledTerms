  "definition": "'Time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography' is a non-invasive, non-contrast-enhanced technique used to visualize both arterial and venous vessels with high spatial resolution. Note: it provides no information regarding directionality nor flow velocity quantification. [adapted from:  [Ferreira and Ramalho, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118434550.ch7)]",
