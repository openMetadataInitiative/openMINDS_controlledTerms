  "definition": "In magnetic resonance imaging, a 'gradient-echo pulse sequence' is a contrast generation technique that rapidly induces bulk changes in the spin magnetization of a sample by applying a series of carefully constructed pulses so that the change in the gradient of the magnetic field is maximized, trading contrast for speed (cf. [Hargreaves (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.23742)).",
