  "definition": "A 'solution' is a special type of homogeneous mixture where at least one substance, called solute, is fully dissolved in another substance, known as a solvent. [adapted from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_(chemistry))",
  "description": "A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. The particles of solute in a solution cannot be seen by the naked eye. A solution does not cause beams of light to scatter. A solution is stable; solutes will not precipitate unless added in excess of the mixture's solubility, at which point the excess would remain in its solid phase, referred to as hypersaturation. The solute from a solution cannot be separated by filtration (or mechanically). It is composed of only one phase. [adapted from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_(chemistry))",
