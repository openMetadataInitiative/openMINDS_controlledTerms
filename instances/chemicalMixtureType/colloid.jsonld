  "definition": "A 'colloid' is a heterogeneous mixture in which one substance consisting of microscopically dispersed insoluble particles is suspended throughout another substance. [adapted from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloid)]",
  "description": "A colloid is a mixture where very small particles of one substance are evenly distributed throughout another substance. They appear very similar to solutions, but the particles are suspended in the solvent rather than fully dissolved. The difference between a colloid and a suspension is that the particles will not settle to the bottom over a period of time, they will stay suspended or float.",
