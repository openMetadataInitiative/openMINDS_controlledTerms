  "definition": "'Taenia tectum of brain' is a white matter of limbic lobe and stria of telencephalon. It is part of the olfactory bulb and supracallosal gyrus.",
  "description": "A continuation ventrally of the supracallosal gyrus beyond the rostrum of the corpus callosum. It is demonstrated histologically by Nissl stain. In the human ( Anthoney-1994 ) and the macaque ( Paxinos-2004 ) it lies on the rostral surface of the lamina terminalis and is considered identical to or part of the paraterminal gyrus. In the rat ( Swanson-1998 ) and the mouse ( Paxinos-2001 ) it is located similarly in relation to the supracallosal gyrus, however, it is a more prominent layered structure that extends rostrally on the medial surface overlying the anterior olfactory nucleus. It is considered part of the olfactory areas (rodent) of the cerebral cortex. In rodents it consists of two parts, the dorsal tenia tecta and the ventral tenia tecta. Note that some authors use the term 'tenia tecta' or 'taenia tecta' as a synonym for the lateral longitudinal stria ( Riley-1943 ).",
