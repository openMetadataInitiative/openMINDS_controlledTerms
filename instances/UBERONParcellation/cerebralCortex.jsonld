  "definition": "'Cerebral cortex' is a central nervous system cell part cluster and central nervous system gray matter layer. It is part of the pallium and cerebral hemisphere gray matter.",
  "description": "The thin layer of gray matter on the surface of the cerebral hemisphere that develops from the telencephalon.  It consists of the neocortex (6 layered cortex or isocortex), the hippocampal formation and the olfactory cortex.The '''cerebral cortex''' is a sheet of neural tissue that is outermost to the cerebrum of the mammalian brain. It plays a key role in memory, attention, perceptual awareness, thought, language, and consciousness. It is constituted of up to six horizontal layers, each of which has a different composition in terms of neurons and connectivity.One of the 10 basic divisions of the cerebrospinal axi. The cerebral cortex is the dorsal topographic division of the endbrain (Kuhlenbeck, 1927), with a basically radial, laminated architecture. The cerebral cortex was described and illustrated for macrodissected adult humans by Vesalius (1543), and the term itself was introduced for macrodissected adult humans by Bauhin (1605).",
