  "definition": "'Medulla oblongata' is part of the brainstem and myelencephalon.",
  "description": "The lower portion of the hindbrain and brainstem located between the pons and spinal cord. This structure contains several descending and ascending tracts, lower cranial nerve nuclei, a significant proportion of the reticular system of the brainstem and other structures (adapted from NCI Thesaurus).The topographic division of the cerebrospinal axis between pons and spinal cord. It was clearly described and illustrated for macrodissected adult humans by Piccolomini (1586, pp. 265, 269; his intracranial medulla oblongata), while the term medulla was used by Winslow (1733, Sect. X, p. 42) and Haller (1747, see translation by Mihles, 1754, pp. 287, 286), and more recently in the classic textbooks of for example Mettler (1948, p. 76) and Carpenter (1976, p. 60).",
