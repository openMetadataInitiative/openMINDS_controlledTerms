  "definition": "The 'premotor cortex' is a regional part of brain. It is part of the cerebral cortex.",
  "description": "The premotor cortex is an area of motor cortex lying within the frontal lobe of the brain. It extends 3 mm anterior to the primary motor cortex, near the Sylvian fissure, before narrowing to approximately 1 mm near the medial longitudinal fissure, which serves as the posterior border for the prefrontal cortex. The premotor cortex is largely equivalent to Brodmann area 6. Activity within this region is critical to the sensory guidance of movement and control of proximal and trunk muscles of the body.
