  "definition": "'Pons' is a regional part of brain. It is part of the metencephalon and brainstem.",
  "description": "The part of the central nervous system lying between the medulla oblongata and the mesencephalon, ventral to the cerebellum, and consisting of a pars dorsalis and a pars ventralis. (MeSH) The ventral topographic division of the hindbrain; the dorsal topographic division is the cerebellum. The middle cerebellar peduncle on the periphery of the macrodissected adult human pons (\"bridge\" in English) was identified by Varolio (1573, Fig. I, f. 17v; also see Clarke & O'Malley 1996, pp. 634-635, 821). Collins (1685, see Tab. 48-L, his caudex of medulla oblongata) identified the pons as defined here, and Haller (1747, see translation by Mihles, 1754, pp. 287, 296) provided the term itself. Pons Varolii (Bell, 1802) is a synonym.",
