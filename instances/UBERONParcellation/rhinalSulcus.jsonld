  "definition": "'Rhinal sulcus' is a sulcus of brain. It is part of the cerebral cortex.",
  "description": "In the human brain, the rhinencephalon appears as a longitudinal elevation, with a corresponding internal furrow, on the under surface of the hemisphere close to the lamina terminalis; it is separated from the lateral surface of the hemisphere by a furrow, the external rhinal fissure (or rhinal sulcus), and is continuous behind with that part of the hemisphere, which will ultimately form the anterior end of the temporal lobe.
