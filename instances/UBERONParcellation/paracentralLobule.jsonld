  "definition": "Paracentral lobule is on the medial surface of the hemisphere and is the continuation of the precentral and postcentral gyri. The paracentral lobule controls motor and sensory innervations of the contralateral lower extremity. It is also responsible for control of defecation and urination. It includes portions of the frontal and parietal lobes: The anterior portion of the paracentral lobule is part of the frontal lobe and is often referred to as the supplementary motor area. The posterior portion is considered part of the parietal lobe and deals with somatosensory of the distal limbs.While the boundary between the lobes, the central sulcus, is easy to locate on the lateral surface of the cerebral hemispheres, this boundary is often discerned in a cytoarchetectonic manner in cases where the central sulcus is not visible on the medial surface.",
  "description": "The 'paracentral lobule' is the junction of the precentral gyrus and postcentral gyrus on the medial surface of the cerebral cortex. It lies across the boundary between the frontal lobe and the parietal lobe.",
