  "definition": "'Intercalated amygdaloid nuclei' is a telencephalic nucleus. It is part of the amygdala.",
  "description": "Discrete clusters of cells intercalated among the major amygdaloid nuclei.  They stain darkly in Nissl stains and have been identified in all mammals.  The main groups lie between the lateral-basolateral nuclear coplex and the central and medial nuclei.  Additional cell groups have been described by some in other locations (Millhouse, O. E. The intercalated cells of the amygdala. J Comp Neurol 247: 246-271, 1986).,  Groups of cells located between the lateral basolateral amygaloid nuclear complex and the central nucleus of the amygdala.
