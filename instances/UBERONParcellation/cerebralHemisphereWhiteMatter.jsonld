  "definition": "'Cerebral hemisphere white matter' is a white matter of telencephalon. It is part of the cerebral hemisphere.",
  "description": "White matter is one of the two main solid components of the central nervous system. It is composed of myelinated nerve cell processes, or axons, which connect various grey matter areas (the locations of nerve cell bodies) of the brain to each other and carry nerve impulses between neurons. Cerebral and spinal white matter do not contain dendrites, which can only be found in grey matter along with neural cell bodies and shorter axons (Christine Fennema-Notestine).",
