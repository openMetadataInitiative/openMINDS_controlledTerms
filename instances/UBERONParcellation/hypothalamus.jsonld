  "definition": "'Hypothalamus' is a regional part of brain. It is part of the limbic system and thalamic complex.",
  "description": "Ventral part of the diencephalon extending from the region of the optic chiasm to the caudal border of the mammillary bodies and forming the inferior and lateral walls of the third ventricle.The ventral topographic division of the interbrain. The first adequate description of the hypothalamus as a layer of gray matter surrounding the lower half of the third ventricle (Galen, c173) was provided by Wharton (1656, see 1966 translation, p. 170). His (1893, pp. 159-162) introduced the term but assigned the preoptic region (Swanson, 1976, pp. 229-235) of the hypothalamus to the telencephalon (His, 1893b). The definition here was introduced for vertebrates by Kuhlenbeck (1927, p. 67, Ch. 9).",
