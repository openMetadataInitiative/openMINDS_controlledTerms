  "definition": "The intraparietal sulcus is located on the lateral surface of the parietal lobe, and consists of an oblique and a horizontal portion.",
  "description": "The intraparietal sulcus (IPS) contains a series of functionally distinct subregions that have been intensively investigated using both single cell neurophysiology in primates and human functional neuroimaging. Its principal functions are related to perceptual-motor coordination (for directing eye movements and reaching) and visual attention. The IPS is also thought to play a role in other functions, including processing symbolic numerical information, visuospatial working memory and interpreting the intent of others. [WP,unvetted].",
