  "definition": "Calcium chloride is an inorganic compound, a salt with the chemical formula CaCl2. [adapted from wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_chloride)]",
  "description": "CaCl2 is a white crystalline solid at room temperature, and it is highly soluble in water. It can be created by neutralising hydrochloric acid with calcium hydroxide. Calcium chloride is commonly encountered as a hydrated solid with generic formula CaCl2·nH2O, where n = 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6. These compounds are mainly used for de-icing and dust control. Because the anhydrous salt is hygroscopic and deliquescent, it is used as a desiccant. [adapted from wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_chloride)]",
