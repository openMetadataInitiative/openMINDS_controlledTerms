  "definition": "The NMDA receptors belong to the class of ionotropic glutamate receptors which can be activated with glutamate and glycine with a voltage-dependent current flow. The blockage of the activated channel through extracellular magnesium (Mg2+) and zinc (Zn2+) ions can only be removed when the neuron is sufficiently depolarized.",
