# openMINDS_controlledTerms

The openMINDS_controlledTerms repository is part of the **open** **M**etadata **I**nitiative for **N**euroscience **D**ata **S**tructures (openMINDS). It contains the schema-templates as well as corresponding terminologies (as JSON-LDs) for all terms that are defined and maintained centrally in this repository. Where applicable, the defined terms are connected to a matching ontological term. Schemas of openMINDS_core as well as openMINDS_SANDS reference to these controlled terms.

For more information please go to the [main openMINDS repository](https://github.com/HumanBrainProject/openMINDS).
